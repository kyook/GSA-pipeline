This is a placeholder directory that mirrors
the directory structure required when the
markup pipeline is run at Caltech.

It must exist in advance; it is not created.

More sensibly and cleanly, it should probably
be placed in a top-level "output" directory:

  output/first_pass_entity_link_tables

It is populated by:
   
  ./scripts/03link.pl
