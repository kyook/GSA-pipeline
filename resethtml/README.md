This is a placeholder directory that mirrors
the directory structure required when the
markup pipeline is run at Caltech.

It must exist in advance; it is not created.

More sensibly and cleanly, it should probably
be placed in a top-level "input" directory:

  input/exclusions

It is hard-coded in and populated by:

  ./scripts/03-link.pl
